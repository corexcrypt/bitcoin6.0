# bitcoin6.0
Top Secret Bitcoin 6.0 - Military Grade e-Payment System framework, found in the darknet is now being released to the general public and developers after 6 years of existance in the dark. This is the most advanced technological piece of bitcoin blockchain crypto framework ever built today. Found floating in the darknet, now being released for use by general public and developers.
# Authors
The latest version "bitcoin 6.0" framework is penned down by Dr. Yuvraj Kumar (location and origin unknown) in the year 2015, however the version 1.0 was written by Satoshi Nakamoto (2 more people included, but never claimed) which became the core of bitcoin cryptocurrency today was written and released in the year 2008 (development year unknown) through a cryptography mailing list.

What is Bitcoin 6.0?
----------------

Bitcoin 6.0 is a top secret digital currency military grade e-payments system (read bitcoin) framework that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world using encrypted gyro-tunnel channel using a central authority mechanism. A purely anti-node non-peer-to-peer version of electronic money would allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without going through a financial institution and node promoters such as digital and gold-miners. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using an anti-node non-peer-to-peer network which is not only distributed but encrypted to the core of the gene. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based genesis-concept combined with military grade chain-reinforced-encryption using AES, SHA, RSA and custom algos, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the genesis-concept. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and re-join the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. However, in the proposed model, the central authority server itself acts as the node and represents the network transport layer by itself which enables it to not to be dependent on individual nodes, and the crypto-formulation continuous at server level. By this process, the dependency on nodes are ruled out and the server (the executioner, in this case) gets all the bits combined in one platform from the beginning to the end using enhanced salting layer, providing the facility of de-centralized defacto standard e-payments within nano seconds or less i.e., account to account transfer using one central block processing schema. This framework eliminates crypto miners and doesn't need mining at all, since the processing happens between layers and central authority decides the transaction's authorization. What a wonderful piece of art!

Development Process
-------------------
The bitcoin 6.0 version code is nowhere to be found and no one knows where it is deployed and by whom. The only reference document is this framework document as found on the darknet.
